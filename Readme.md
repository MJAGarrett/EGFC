# EGFC

This is a personal website made to practice front-end design. The subject, EGFC, is a fictional football club that I created as an excuse to design a website.

Currently, the site is only a hero and a nav bar. This project will be added to as and when I have a new idea and time to work on it.

## Technologies

None beyond basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Launch

Simply open up the index.html file in a browser. Or you can use the live server extension for Visual Studio Code.

### Project Status <a name="status" />

As of writing this Readme, October 14, 2022, this is an ongoing project.

### Future Plans (as of 08/06/2022) <a name="plans" />

The short-term plan is simply finish the first page. Afterwards, I plan to add a server and basic lorem ipsem to fill in player details, game stat, etc.

### What I Have Learned <a name="learnings" />

I took inspiration from FC Barcelona's first page for the design of the hero and sections of the navbar. This was, so far, good practice for several aspects of front-end work. I practiced using srs-sets for responsive design, making sure drop down menus are accessible, and looking at how a professional site set itself up was very informative.

### Attributions <a name="attributions" />

### Thank You <a name="thanks" />

Thank you for your interest! I am just beginning my coding journey and as such there are likely many things I did inefficiently, or perhaps there are anti-patterns I used that I was unaware were not recommended, or my comment style could be better, etc. If so, please let me know a better way. My pride can take it.

Also if you are new to coding as well, I hope that my code can help you in some way. Either through inspiration or serving as some kind of example.
